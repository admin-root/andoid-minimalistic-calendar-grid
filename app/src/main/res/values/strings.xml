    <string name="info_msg">This app shows all your calendar events in a minimalistic grid. The view is inspired by Jorte Calendar because the month view is very clear.
Unfortunately, Jorte comes with a lot of functionality that I do not need and blows-up the app. This app just shows your event per month, gives you an event list per day and opens the
default celendar app for creating new events and viewing event details. So, for editing your events you have the full power of the Android calendar app with a month view that is clearer.</string>
